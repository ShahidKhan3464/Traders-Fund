            eligible to be funded with capital to manage and scale up to 3+ Million Dollars as a Pro Funded Trader earning 90% of the

            To avoid any confusion, after a client becomes a Pro Funded Trader, he/she will be provided with a demo account with virtual
            funds. The Pro Trader's Funded Account is connected to our Proprietary Trading Firmâ€™s live trading account with real capital.
            That is where we generate real cash flow. Clients are entitled to up to 90% of profits generated on the Pro Trader's Funded
            Account. This solution is administratively much easier and gives our company the freedom to actively manage risk in certain
            markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not have upgrading options so you need to choose the appropriate account size right at the beginning when you are
            configuring your Pro Trader Challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are successful and stable in the long run, the account balance can be increased according to our Scaling Plan. The
            Scale-up can only be accommodated during the Profit Split processing. If your account is about to fulfill the eligibility
            criteria, please contact us a few business days ahead of your upcoming Profit Split Day so we can review your track record and
            provide a scaled-up Pro Trader's Funded Account for you for the upcoming trading period.
