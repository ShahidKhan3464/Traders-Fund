                                        Trading in financial markets involves substantial risk, including the risk of
                                        losing a significant portion or all of
                                        your capital. However, it is crucial to understand that the capital allocated
                                        during various phases of our program does
                                        not belong to the trader. <br/>

                                            working with virtual funds placed within
                                            demo accounts. These funds are not real capital and carry no personal
                                            financial risk to the trader.

                                            <b>Funded Phase Capital:</b> In the funded phase, traders utilize capital
                                            extended by Pro Traders Fund, distinct from
                                            personal ownership by the trader. The Company maintains complete control
                                            (custody) of the funds at all times, with all
                                            profits generated deemed as company assets. The distribution of payment is
                                            considered a commission for services
                                            rendered by the independent contractor considering that all requirements are
                                            met. Consequently, in the event of any
                                            breach of contractual terms by the independent contractor, entitlement to
                                            payment will be forfeited.

                                            <b>Risk Management Criteria:</b> To mitigate risk and protect our private
                                            fund, specific risk management parameters
                                            are in place. Traders are required to operate within these predefined
                                            guidelines. Any breach of these criteria results
                                            in automatic forfeiture, as it indicates a failure to trade within our
                                            established risk tolerance.
