              <h2>What is a Prop Trading Firm?</h2>
              <p>
                A prop trading firm is a company that specializes in proprietary trading. This means that the firm trades with its own
                capital, rather than on behalf of clients. The goal of these firms is to make profits from their own trading activities.

              <p>
                Trading with your own capital can be a risky venture, and many traders are turning to proprietary trading funds as an
                alternative. Proprietary trading funds (PTFs) offer traders the opportunity to trade with company capital instead of their
                own, allowing them to benefit from the potential profits without taking on the risk of trading with their own money. Here
                are five reasons why traders should choose PTFs over their own capital.
