              <p className="font-normal">
                You must have seen influencers boasting around the internet about how you can make lots of money with forex trading sharing
                various tips and tricks. And you as a dreamer might have started thinking of how to spend the money you will earn through
                those trading tips.
                <br />
                <br />
                But the truth is people lose money in the forex market more often than you think! In fact as per an FCA report 76% of forex
                traders lost money in the past few financial years.
                <br />
                <br />
                The percentage of beginner traders losing money is even higher with some estimates suggesting up to 95%! Again one of the
                main reasons for these losses is lack of adequate knowledge. It’s insane how people are risking their money without proper
                knowledge and experience.
                <br />
                <br />
                To make things easier we at Pro Traders Fund, one of the best proprietary trading firm are here with ten amazing tips from

              <h2 className="pb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Start With Understanding The Market</h2>
              <p className="font-normal">
                The foreign exchange market (forex) is open for trading currency pairings Monday through Friday, around the clock.
                Currencies are available in pairs, consisting of a base currency and a quote currency, and are given a three-letter
                identification identifier. The quantity of quote currency required to purchase one unit of base currency is shown by the
                exchange rate.
                <br />
                <br />
                Forex trading can be done in several ways, such as by switching major currency pairs based on real-time data or by entering
                standard or privately negotiated contracts (forward and futures markets, respectively).
                <br />

                </a>{' '}
                we would highly advise you to learn these words and the lingo used in the forex market so that when you start trading, you
                won't feel like the child whose dog ate his homework. Although research takes time, it will pay you greatly in the form of
                hassles and mistakes avoided.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <h2 className="pb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Formulate A Trading Plan and Stick To It </h2>
              <p>
                A strategy is essential for any successful forex trader as it guides them in determining which main currency pairings to
                monitor for trading opportunities, how much to trade, and when to exit a transaction and cut losses.
                <br />
                <br />
                Having a plan aids in making thoughtful choices. Use the outline of someone else's strategy or get in touch with the best
                proprietary trading firm if you have no idea how to create one.
                <br />
                <br />
                But don't forget to take into account your objectives, driving forces, risk tolerance, tactics, available funds, and time
                commitment. Your trading plan will be easier to use the more customized it is.
                <br />
                <br />
                Do not forget to provide an assessment criterion. Above all, be sure that every trade is executed inside the confines of
                your plan.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h2 className="pb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Practice As Much As You Can</h2>
              <p className="font-normal">
                Almost all of us have heard the saying “practice makes a man perfect”, and the same works with forex trading, at least that
                is what professionals at our Prop trading firm believe and work on.
                <br />
                <br />
                After creating a trading plan and searching the literature and the internet for forex trading ideas, test everything under
                actual market circumstances. New traders can test their tactics with a virtual trading account from SPT without having to
                risk real money.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h2 className="pb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Analyze How Far You Can Go </h2>
              <p className="font-normal">
                The most important lesson to learn from direct trading is to never risk money you can't afford to lose. It's a typical error
                made by novice traders.
                <br />
                <br />
                For instance, you choose to exchange money for rent or school expenses. Setting aside some cash, just like you would for a
                vacation, makes sense.
                <br />
                <br />
                After you have funds, decide how much you are willing to risk on each trade and choose an appropriate multiplier (leverage
                ratio) to reduce your exposure. If not, you'll quickly begin to lose money.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h2 className="pb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Have An Understanding Of When To Leave</h2>
              <p>
                Knowing when to enter and leave a position is a necessary skill for forex trading. However, since nobody has the time to sit
                and watch movements on a graph every minute of every hour, it's more practical to use stop orders to limit losses or lock in
                profits based on how the market moves about the entered position, and limit orders to enter a trade automatically once the
                price reaches a specific point.
                <br />
                <br />
                These orders might not be filled at the predetermined price, though, if the market is moving swiftly.
                <br />
                <br />
                Additionally, setting stop and limit orders too close together may result in losses and early closing. As part of your
                trading plan, you should always exercise caution when establishing stop and limit orders.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 className="pb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Keep Your Emotions Off The Table</h2>
              <p>
                We as a professional Prop trading firm would highly recommend keeping emotions aside if you really want to become a
                successful forex trader. The secret to successful forex trading is intellect; never, ever trade out of fear or greed.
                <br />
                <br />
                Because of FOMO, they may pressure you to enter a trade later than you should or to abandon your plan as soon as you start
                to lose money. Emotions are a necessary component of being human.
                <br />
                <br />
                Even the most skilled traders occasionally fall victim to them; the only difference is that they quickly recognize the
                situation and begin responding rationally. With each trade decision you make, you'll become more adept at managing your
                emotions.
                <br />
                <br />
                Make wise choices and keep in mind that some things are out of your control rather than becoming overly attached to the
                results.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 className="pb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Start Slow and Steady </h2>
              <p>
                It's never easy to go from trading with a million dollars in demo accounts to merely having a few hundred dollars in real
                investor accounts. The gains aren't as large as they were in the other account, and the hazards are genuine.
                <br />
                <br />
                Since it is hard to turn a few hundred dollars into a million dollars in a year, trading small amounts of money has the
                drawback of providing no psychological stimulation.
                <br />
                <br />
                Beginner traders should keep in mind that consistency is the most important factor. Even if the market moves against you,
                stay disciplined and adhere to your trading plan.
                <br />
                <br />
                Like every trader, you will occasionally experience losses. The secret is to maintain your composure, concentrate on your
                objectives, and develop the ability to spot and seize business chances.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 className="pb-2 text-2xl font-bold">The Bottom Line</h2>
              <p>
                Entering into forex trading is not an easy task to do, of course, you’ll face some losses in the beginning, but that doesn't
                mean you get demotivated and end things right up there.
                <br />
                <br />
                With the right steps and guidance of a Prop trading firm, you can make a good amount of money out of forex trading, just
                make sure you keep the above-mentioned tips in mind and do not enter the market with no knowledge.
