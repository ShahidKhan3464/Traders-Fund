      Once you complete the Phase 1 and Phase 2 evaluation challenge for the One Step Pro Trader Challenge and Premium Pro Trader Challenge,
      or if you have a Premium Plus Instant Funded Account, you can request a profit split payout.
      <br /> <br />
      For One Step Pro Trader Funded accounts, there is a 14-day waiting period before you can request the first profit split payout. During
      this time, you need to accumulate a minimum of 7 trading days and ensure that your account is profitable.
      <br /> <br />
      After the first payout, you will be upgraded to weekly payouts, allowing you to request profit split payouts every 7 days as long as
      you are in profit.
      <br /> <br />
      Two Step Premium Funded accounts have immediate access to bi-weekly payouts after a 14-day waiting period, provided they have
      completed the minimum of 7 trading days and are profitable.
      <br /> <br />
      Premium Plus Instant Funded accounts have their own rules. After a 10-day waiting period, they need to have a minimum of 5 trading
      days. Once these conditions are met, they can request a profit split payout every 7 days as long as their account remains profitable.
      <br /> <br />
      Please note that all accounts, regardless of type, must meet the profit threshold and any other applicable criteria to be eligible for
      payouts.
